        <h1> Our Business | History</h1>
      
          <p> Chill & Eat iKota was born out of the desire to challenge what is the status quo.

Founded in November of 2017 2Selai started as a small shop in the garage of a Soweto home. Chill & Eat iKota  has an events arm with which we can reach a wider range of cliental and explore our culinary expertise in the Kota industry.

Our primary product offering is a Kota, a hollowed-out quarter loaf filled with a variety of ingredients.</p>
